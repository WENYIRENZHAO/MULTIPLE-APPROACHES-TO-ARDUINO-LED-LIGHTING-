# On the Many Ways to Make LEDs Blink: A Small Inquiry with Arduino

This project explores multiple ways to implement LED control on Arduino, demonstrating different programming structures, logic styles, and abstraction techniques.

Rather than showing a single “blink”, this repository compares how different code structures achieve the same behavior, helping beginners understand logic flow and helping advanced learners recognize patterns in embedded programming.
